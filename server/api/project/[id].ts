Vercel offers fast and reliable hosting, automatic SSL certificates, and continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) workflows. This ensures that the website is always online and updated with the latest content.</p> <p class='uppercase font-bold'>Why It Matters</p> <p>This website is more than just a showcase of Annemiek\'s work. It is also a way for her to connect with her audience and share her opinions and perspectives on various issues.

The company offers various services for homeowners and renters in the island, such as cleaning, maintenance, security and concierge. The website showcases these services in a clear and attractive way, with icons, images and descriptions. It also has some testimonials from satisfied customers who have used the company's services before. And of course, it has a contact form where potential clients can get in touch with the company and request a quote.</p> <p>The website is built with Vue 3, Typescript and bootstrap. Vue 3 is a modern and powerful framework for creating reactive and dynamic web applications. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework that provides responsive and consistent design elements. I chose these technologies because they are fast, reliable and easy to work with. The website is also optimized for performance and accessibility. It uses lazy loading to reduce the initial loading time and improve the user experience. The website is fully responsive and adapts to different screen sizes and devices. </p> <p>I'm very proud of how the website turned out and I hope you like it too.

As a freelancer myself, I know how hard it can be to manage multiple gigs from different apps, such as Youngones, Temper, Jobner and others. Working with a spreadsheet is outdated and can be a headache.</p> <p>That's why I created FreeFlexr: an online tool that lets you connect your accounts from various freelance platforms and automatically syncs your data. You can see all your jobs in one dashboard, filter them by date, status, client or platform. You can also generate reports and invoices with just a few clicks. And the best part is: FreeFlexr is completely free to use!</p> <p>FreeFlexr is built with modern web technologies that ensure a fast and responsive user interface. The frontend is coded in Angular 14 and Material Design components. The backend is powered by Hasura GraphQL engine that connects to a PostgreSQL database hosted on Heroku. The app also uses Firebase for authentication and storage.</p> <p>You can follow the development here: https://github.com/itsmeromian/freeflexr</p> <p>I hope you find it useful and I'd love to hear your feedback and suggestions.</p> <p>Thanks for reading!</p>",
